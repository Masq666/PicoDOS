# PicoDOS
A small Realmode OS written in ASM, sort of DOS compatible.

PicoDOS does not and will never support every interrupt function that MS-DOS does, the philosophy behind PicoDOS is to only implement the functions that is needed to run the most popular DOS games and applications.

System Requirements

CPU: 386+
RAM: 640kb
DISK: Floppy or HDD

Tools needed

To write applications for PicoDOS you can use your favourite DOS compiler or assembler.

But to build PicoDOS itself you will need the following:

FASM -- Flat Assembler
A way to add programs to the floppy or HD image
